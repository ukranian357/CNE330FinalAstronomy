# CNE330FinalAstronomy
astronomy python code
this code takes the original code from Runestone Lab and creates a Black Hole in the center of a galaxy that has a weak gravitational pull causing the planets to be pulled away from their normal circular oblong orbit around the sun and to be pulled into the black hole. the black hole has a weak gravitational force therefore while the planets are knocked off their circular orbit and pulled towards the black hole the gravitation force only pulls them towards the black hole but they escape its pull and continue on their new orbit going in a straight line on their way out of the galaxy.
